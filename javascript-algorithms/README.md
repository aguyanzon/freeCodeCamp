<p>While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive.
In this course I've learned about differents concepts of JavaScript were explained in the following steps:</p>

* Basic JavaScript
* ES6 (ECMAScript6)
* Regular Expressions
* Debugging
* Basic Data Structures
* Basic Algorithm Scripting
* Object Oriented Programming
* Functional Programming
* Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

Finally, I resolved five JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures problems:

* Palindrome Checker
* Roman Numeral Converter
* Caesars Cipher
* Telephone Number Validator
* Cash Register
