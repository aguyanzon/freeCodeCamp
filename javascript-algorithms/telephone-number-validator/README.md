<h1>Telephone Number Validator</h1>
<p>In this project, I had to build a function that return True if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.</p>
<p>In this problem, the user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers:</p>
<div>
  555-555-5555
  <br>
  (555)555-5555
  <br>
  (555) 555-5555
  <br>  
  555 555 5555
  <br>
  5555555555
  <br>
  1 555 555 5555
</div>
<br>
<p> If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1.</p>
