<h1>Palindrome Checker</h1>
<p>In this project, I had to build a function that returns <i>True</i> if the given string was a palindrome or <i>False</i> if it wasn't.</p>

<p>A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
For example, <i>A man, a plan, a canal. Panama.</i></p>
