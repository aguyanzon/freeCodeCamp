<h1>Caesars Cipher</h1>
<p>One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.</p>
<p>A common modern use is the <strong>ROT13</strong> cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.</p>
<p>In this project, I had to build a function that takes a <strong>ROT13</strong> encoded string as input and returns a decoded string</p>
<p>For example, if the string is <i>"SERR PBQR PNZC"</i> the function should return <i>"FREE CODE CAMP".</i>
